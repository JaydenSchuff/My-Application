          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I love to play video games and dungeouns and dragons. I watch anime and am obsessed with mythologies around the world!
            I even have multiple tattoos of Greek Mythology since that one is my favorite.
           Before coding I tried to become a baker and even went to culinary school but found that I liked it more as a hobby then a job.
           I am a Father and a Husband with 2 silly cats.
